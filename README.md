# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built as a single-page application. It showcases my projects, skills, and academic background in Computer Science, with a focus on AI/ML.

## ✨ Features

Dynamic Background: An interactive "NET" animation from Vanta.js runs across the entire site.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS, accessible on desktop and mobile.

Frosted Glass UI: Content sections are semi-transparent with a backdrop-blur effect, allowing the animation to show through.

Project Showcase: A grid layout detailing key projects like EdiGenAI, AUREXA-SE, and Sentinel Project.

Contact Links: Easy-to-access links for Email, Academic Email, and Phone.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling and layout (utility-first CSS framework).

JavaScript (ES6+): To initialize and configure the background animation.

Vanta.js (with three.js): For the interactive WebGL background animation.
